# Client-Side Web Development Tools, Libraries & Frameworks

*Below are the tools, libraries & frameworks that you^ should use when building client-side web applications.*
*^These are what I am currently using.*

## Tools

*Tools generally make things easier, they may automate your workflow or validate your code*

## Frameworks

*Frameworks add structure, something along the lines of MVC.*

**Backbone.js** 
Backbone.js gives structure to web applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing API over a RESTful JSON interface.

**Angular.js** 
HTML is great for declaring static documents, but it falters when we try to use it for declaring dynamic views in web-applications. AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.
